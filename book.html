        <h2>Is the expansion of the Universe speeding up?</h2>
        <p>
          When astronomers look at the light coming from atoms in a distant galaxy, they find that its wavelength is stretched and is said to be redshifted.

          They interpret this as being because of the expansion of the Universe in the time the light has been travelling across space to the Earth.
          
          Think of a wave painted on a balloon that is being inflated and you will get some understanding of the effect.
          
          If the Universe is expanding at a steady rate, then light from a galaxy that has been stretched to twice its normal wavelength means that the Universe has doubled in size since the light was emitted.
          
          But how can astronomers check whether the Universe is expanding steadily?
          
          They use a ‘standard candle’ – a celestial object of known luminosity and distance in our cosmic backyard.
          Astronomers then look for a similar object in the distant Universe.

If its redshift implies that it is twice as far away, it should be 4 times as faint; if its redshift shows it to be three times as far away, then it should be 9 times as faint, and so on.

In 1998, teams of scientists from America and Australia observed a type of standard candle in remote galaxies known as a Type Ia supernova.

They discovered that the supernovae whose redshifts implied they were twice as far away as others were less than a quarter as bright.

From this data, the scientists deduced that the Universe had expanded more than expected since the light from the supernovae had set out on the long journey to Earth.

Therefore, the Universe’s expansion had speeded up since the stars first exploded.

          If the Universe is expanding, is getting to distant planets possible?</h2>
        <p>
          The Universe was born about 13.8 billion years ago. Consequently, we can only see stars and galaxies whose light has taken less than 13.8 billion years to reach the Earth.

          This creates an ‘observable Universe’ bounded by a spherical ‘horizon’ centred on the Earth. Beyond the horizon are stars and galaxies we can’t yet see because their light is still travelling to Earth.
          
          The further we look into the Universe with our telescopes, the further back in time we see galaxies because of the finite speed of light.
          
          Distant galaxies are closer in time to the Big Bang explosion, so they are moving faster.
          
          At the distance of the horizon, they are receding at exactly the speed of light.
          
          We can’t see objects beyond this because their light would have needed to travel faster than light, which is impossible.
          
          Similarly, we can’t travel to them because we would have to travel faster than light, and the speed of light, as far as we know, is the cosmic speed limit for all bodies with mass.
          
          However, if we could travel at the speed of light we would be able to reach all stars within the observable Universe.

        <h2>Has the Universe's mass increased since the Big Bang?</h2>
        <p>
          Energy can’t be created or destroyed, only converted from one kind into another.

So for instance, a light bulb converts electrical energy into light energy and heat energy.

But does this principle of the ‘conservation of energy’ – and all energy has a mass equivalent – apply to the Universe as a whole? We think so.

However, quantum theory tells us that nature turns a blind eye if energy is created for a short enough period before vanishing again.

The Universe could therefore have arisen as a ‘quantum fluctuation’, a seed of mass-energy appearing out of nothing.

According to inflation theory, most of the mass-energy of the Universe came from the energy of the vacuum – the ultimate free lunch, as cosmologists say.

        <h2>Was the rate of the expansion of the Universe ever zero?</h2>
        <p>
          There was once a popular idea that the Universe had contracted down to a ‘Big Crunch’ from which it bounced into the Big Bang.

If so, then there would have been an instant – at the changeover point when contraction finished and expansion began – when the Universe’s expansion rate was zero.

However, the ‘bouncing’ Universe idea took a blow in the 1960s when Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking proved that the Universe must have begun in a ‘singularity’.

Such an instant of infinite density and temperature breaks the laws of physics and precludes the existence of a pre-Big Bang era.

The ‘singularity theorems’ may not be the last word, however. A better ‘quantum’ theory of gravity may be free of singularities and permit a bounce.
